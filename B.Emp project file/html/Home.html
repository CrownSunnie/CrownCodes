			<p>By some estimates Nigerian tertiary education institutions produce up to five hundred thousand graduates every year.And about half University graduates in Nigeria in a year are unemployed, now to talk less of Polytenic graduates that are downgraded in the labour market.</p>
			<p>New data published by Nigeria's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) pegs the unemployment rate at 14.2% in the last quarter of 2016, up from 13.9% in the preceding quarter. It's the ninth consecutive quarter that the unemployment rate in Nigeria has increased.</p>
			<p>As at June 2018,the report noted that Nigeria has a high youth unemployment (25.2%), while about 61.5% of those with gainful employment are working below their minimum capability and capacity.The unemployment rate in Nigeria as at 2016 was estimated at 21% by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).</p>
			<p>And this is obvious to notice that with records kept, that Nigeria unemployment rate as almost being doubled in the last 2 years. </p>
			<p>So many youths are unemployed today because of some economic reasons like bribery, corruption, tribalism. But it is also candid to admit that some youths are unemployed today because of poor courtesy in interview. B.EMP(Be Employed)'s aim to to address this issues.</p>
